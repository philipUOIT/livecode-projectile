# livecode-projectile
A simple implementation of an Euler integrator for projectile motion. This program was written (mostly) live, in lecture for SOFE-2850U in Fall 2017.

Next week, we will add drag and stopping conditions. The drag will make the output more interesting. Implementing stopping conditions in a generic way force us to introduce lambdas and templates
